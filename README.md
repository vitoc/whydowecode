Why I code - Vito Chin
======================

I find myself driven to code in many situations. There may be other volitions, such as the urge to reach out to someone for help or collaboration, to divide and delegate and etc. But generally, given a domain of challenge or a problem space, the invariable vein of my subconscious will be that an eventual form of near-perfect code can exist to establish a model for a scoped domain that can make the reality being modelled or our way of dealing with that reality better. The motivations to that effect are:

To understand
-------------

Coding is a convenient representative of a string of activities that result in code finally being typed into a computer. Usually, there are some or even a lot of thinking that goes beforehand. These thinking, either individually or in a group, is part of the coding process. You cannot code without first understanding the challenge at hand. Therefore, coding is a natural way to force or direct an understanding. After some time, a self-reinforcing cycle is established. Better understanding of the domain then creates greater urges to code, and so on.

To immerse
----------

Once an understanding is established, what follows is usually an extension of that understanding by bringing it into the realm of computer science and mathematics. This usually happens around the later stage towards codification and is one of the reason why the urge to code exist. This is the stage where coders immerse themselves in an even more enlightened understanding of the domain by meshing the translated realities of the domain with the grandiose possibilities that computer science and mathematics offers. The classic base case example of such immersion is perhaps the application of Euclid's algorithm to find the most efficient way to tile a square floor with square tiles.

To connect
----------

The understanding, the immersion and the eventual manifestation of all of that in code becomes a way to connect with the universe. For code that we write for ourselves, it is that special moment where we find solace in the order that we'd formed in our mind and in code for that fleeting moment of existence somewhere in the vast eternity of life. For code that makes its way into products with users or shared plainly on the worldwide web, we share another self-reinforcing transformation of that experience.
